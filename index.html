            <p>
                I am a 27-year-old DevSecOps engineer currently residing in Australia. My passion for computers ignited at the age of 4, where my fascination with computer games evolved into a deep-seated curiosity to explore and understand the intricacies of technology. This early interest led me to pursue a career in Computer Engineering.

                I earned my bachelor's degree from Pune University in India, a foundational step that laid the groundwork for my journey. Seeking to broaden my horizons, I embarked on a Masters in Computer Science at the University of Wollongong in Australia, where I faced and overcame unfamiliar challenges. What has sustained me throughout this journey is my unwavering commitment to learning, continuously encountering and solving problems that stimulate my intellectual growth.

                Beyond academic pursuits, I find great satisfaction in engaging with Bug bounty programs and crafting tools that automate processes using various programming languages. This not only allows me to harness my creativity but also enables me to accomplish exciting and meaningful tasks. I thrive on the dynamic nature of technology, always seeking opportunities to delve into new realms and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of the digital world.
